Nothing to see here, just a workaround for Apollo Server

```graphql
_makeEmpty(
  id: String
): String
```


### Arguments

#### [`id`](#) ([`String`](/adminidentity/api/graphql-admin/reference/scalars/string))




### Type

#### [`String`](/adminidentity/api/graphql-admin/reference/scalars/string)

The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.
