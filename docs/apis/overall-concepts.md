# Overall API Concepts

The APIs are split into 3 different categories based on the area of the business they interact with: DemandHQ, Supplier, and Shared (both).

## IDs

IDs are prefixed with a 5-character type, split by a dash, and then have a date created at sortable random ID appended to it. i.e. `prdct-adthcnhT234podvntae%g`. All IDs are globally unique to the platform.
