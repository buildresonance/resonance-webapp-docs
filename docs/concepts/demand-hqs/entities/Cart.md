# Cart

A Cart exists to be a temporary holding place for a [Customer](Customer) to add [Variants](Variant) that he or she wish to eventually purchase. Carts can be associated with an actual customer, or simply to a device anonoymously for a shopper who is not logged in.

## Saved For Later

In addition to the normal cart functionality, a bucket of [Variants](Variant) exists that are saved for a later cart. These will not be immediately purchased, but can be added to a future cart when the [Customer](Customer) is ready.
