# Nav

Nav is an item within a navigational heirarchy of some kind, most often viewed as a link inside a menu. This gives possible structure and parent/child relationships to things like [Collections](Collection), or just random links. A Nav can have other Navs as children, and unless it is the Root Nav, a single Nav as a parent.

A quick example of a possible Nav relationship tree might be `Camping` > `Tents` > `4-season`, `3-season`.

You can also have less collection oriented Nav Trees: `Blog` > `Camping` > `How to start a fire`.
