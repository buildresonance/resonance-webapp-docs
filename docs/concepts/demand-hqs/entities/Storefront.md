# Storefront

A Storefront is an application of some variety that presents an e-commerce experience directly to [Customers](Customer) and facilitates the browsing, shopping, and ordering of [Products](Product) and [Variants](Variant). The primary way a Storefront gets built is by using responses from the Storefront API, which is purpose-built to handle the task.

In general, Storefronts typically contain [Products](Product) for purchase using a [Cart](Cart), which gets turned into an [Order](Order) by creating a Checkout. Storefronts may also contain [Collections](Collection) and other [Pages](Page) that facilitate a fuller experience.
