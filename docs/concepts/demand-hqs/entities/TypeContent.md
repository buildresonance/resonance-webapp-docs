# TypeContent

These are small entities, meant to populate a small amount of content on some high-level group pages. For example, for a blog, you would have a page that had the blog title, maybe a short description, and listed articles. The title and description would live on a [PageTypeContent](Page) entity for the `pageType` that matched all of the blog articles.

At time of writing [CollectionTypeContent](Collection) and [PageTypeContent](Page) exist.
