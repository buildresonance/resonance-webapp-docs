# Recommendations

Recommendations are a powerful way to increase customer engagement with a website. They provide contextualized results for questions like "What should I buy next?" or "What are other people buying?".

Below you will find a complete list of recommendations Resonance provides and a description of each.

## Product Recommendations

Product Recommendations help customers find products they are likely to purchase. They generally increase Average Order Value and Conversion Rate by guiding customers to products they are likely to purchase.

### Content-Based Recommendations

Content-Based Recommendations are recommendations that are based on the content of the product. 

**Advantages**

- Low customer activity required to provide beneficial recommendations.
- Performs better than alternatives when the product catalog is vast.
- Can be used to provide recommendations for new products.

**Disadvantages**

- Generally lower impact than interaction-based recommendations when vast scale has been achieved (but more effective otherwise).

#### Recently Viewed Products

Recently Viewed recommendations show products that the customer has recently viewed. This is a great way to help customers find products they have already shown interest in, but potentially forgotten about.

#### More Like This Product(s)

More Like This recommendations show products that are similar to the product the customer is currently viewing. This is a great way to help customers find products that they are currently shopping for.

#### Like (Your) Recent Activity Product(s)

Like Recent Activity recommendations show products that are similar to the products the customer has recently viewed. This is a combination of personalizing to the customer's activity and finding contextually similar products. This is generally the most effective content-based recommendation and is often used as a backup for "Products for you" recommendations (that primarily use interaction metrics).

### Interaction-Based Recommendations

Interaction-Based Recommendations are recommendations that are based on the interactions of the customer, and generally use collaborative filtering to find similar customers, then provide recommendations based on what the group has seen success with.

**Advantages**

- Generally higher impact than content-based recommendations. Causation is more clear than correlation.
- Performs better than alternatives when the product catalog is small.

**Disadvantages**

- Requires a large amount of customer activity to provide beneficial recommendations, without which, content-based recommendations are generally more effective.
