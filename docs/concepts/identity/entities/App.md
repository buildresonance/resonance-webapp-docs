# App

An App is the primary entity that is built in the AdminIdentity domain, and is the primary purpose of a [Partner](Partner) (to create them). Apps are somewhat like a user, in that they ask for certain permissions and do certain tasks with those permissions. However, Apps contain two app clients, which are the entities that are very, very similar to a [User](User). Two are provided for possible credential rotation.
