# What is Resonance?

Resonance is an e-commerce platform focused on Marketplaces. A Marketplace is an e-commerce site with multiple suppliers to sell goods from. This means an individual product SKU may come from more than one possible supplier. This enables an ecommerce site to expand selection, have greater in stock percentages, and satisfy more customers. Resonance simplifies this experience for e-commerce merchants.

Resonance is composed of [Suppliers](suppliers/supplier_concepts) and [DemandHQs](demand-hq/demand-hq-concepts). These can be viewed similarly to the economics concepts of Supply and Demand.
