# Notifications

Notifications exist to automate workflows throughout Resonance. You can find them in Demand and Supply.

## Status

Status can be one of 4 values:

1. FRESH - This notification has not been touched by anyone.
2. ACKNOWLEDGED - This notification has been seen and claimed by someone, but not acted upon. This is similar to saying "I'll do it."
3. RESOLVED - This notification has been acted upon and is now resolved.
4. IGNORED - This notification has been ignored and will not be acted upon.

### Actions

Some Notifications have actions associated with them. These actions can link to to an associated page or make changes on your behalf.

Examples of possible actions include:

-   Linking to the Edit Product page for an Alert that you have a published Product with no associated Storefronts.
-   Changing a Variant price for an Alert that your Product margin has fallen below a threshold.

### Categories

Notifications will be sorted into conceptual categories to help your sort out your workflow. You can also filter by these categories.
