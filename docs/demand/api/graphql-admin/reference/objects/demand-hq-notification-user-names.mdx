These users will get notified if something requires attention for this DemandHq.
If none are provided, ownerUserName will be notified.

```graphql
type DemandHqNotificationUserNames {
  catalog: [String!]
  commerce: [String!]
  orders: [String!]
}
```


### Fields

#### [`catalog`](#) ([`[String!]`](/demand/api/graphql-admin/reference/scalars/string))

All notifications for the catalog side (Products, Variants, etc.).


#### [`commerce`](#) ([`[String!]`](/demand/api/graphql-admin/reference/scalars/string))

All notifications for the commerce side, besides orders.


#### [`orders`](#) ([`[String!]`](/demand/api/graphql-admin/reference/scalars/string))

These are part of commerce, but are a specific enough case to be handled separately.
