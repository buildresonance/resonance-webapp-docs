```


### Arguments

#### [`input`](#) ([`CollectionCreateInput!`](/developers/demandhq-apis/demand-api/graphql/reference/inputs/collection-create-input))




### Type

#### [`Collection`](/developers/demandhq-apis/demand-api/graphql/reference/objects/collection)

A Collection is a group of products, what may often be referred to as a "Category Page" of some variety.
In reality, a collection is far more flexible and can be used to represent any
product grouping, and the collectionType can help differentiate between them.
