Add a new Page to a DemandHq.

Requires the page/write permission on the given DemandHq


```graphql
createPage(
  input: PageCreateInput!
): Page!

```


### Arguments

#### `input` ([`PageCreateInput`](/developers/demandhq-apis/demand-api/graphql/reference/inputs/page-create-input))




### Type

#### [`Page`](/developers/demandhq-apis/demand-api/graphql/reference/objects/page) 

A Page is a part of the Demand Domain and represents a page with textual and
image content on it, that has nothing to do with products.
This can range from "About Us" pages to Blog articles. Use the "pageType" field to differentiate.
Pages do not have locales specified, but since everything would be different
anyway, "pageType" can be a composite key with locale in it.
