These users will get notified if something requires attention for this DemandHq.
If none are provided, ownerUserName will be notified.


```graphql
type DemandHqNotificationUserNames {
  catalog: [String!]
  commerce: [String!]
  orders: [String!]
}
```


### Fields

#### `catalog` ([`String`](/developers/demandhq-apis/demand-api/graphql/reference/scalars/string))

All notifications for the catalog side (Products, Variants, etc.).


#### `commerce` ([`String`](/developers/demandhq-apis/demand-api/graphql/reference/scalars/string))

All notifications for the commerce side, besides orders.


#### `orders` ([`String`](/developers/demandhq-apis/demand-api/graphql/reference/scalars/string))

These are part of commerce, but are a specific enough case to be handled separately.
