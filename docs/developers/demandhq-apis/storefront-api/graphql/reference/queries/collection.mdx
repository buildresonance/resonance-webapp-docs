Get a collection by its slug.

Requires the publiccollection/read scope.

```graphql
collection(
  slug: String!
): PublicCollection
```


### Arguments

#### [`slug`](#) ([`String!`](/developers/demandhq-apis/storefront-api/graphql/reference/scalars/string))




### Type

#### [`PublicCollection`](/developers/demandhq-apis/storefront-api/graphql/reference/objects/public-collection)

A Collection is a group of products, what may often be referred to as a "Category Page" of some variety.
In reality, a collection is far more flexible and can be used to represent any
product grouping, and the collectionType can help differentiate between them.
