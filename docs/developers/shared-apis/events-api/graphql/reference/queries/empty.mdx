Nothing to see here, just a workaround for Apollo Server

```graphql
_empty: String

```

### Type

#### [`String`](/developers/shared-apis/events-api/graphql/reference/scalars/string)

The `String` scalar type represents textual data, represented as UTF-8 character sequences. The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.
