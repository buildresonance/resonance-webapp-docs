# Supply API Concepts

The Supply API provides admin functionality for Suppliers. This functionality is separated into 3 smaller domain groups:

-   Metadata
-   Management
-   Distribution

## Metadata

This contains the functionality surrounding the basics of the Supply domain. Suppliers themselves and permissions are the primary entities.

## Management

This contains the functionality surrounding inventory and product (variant) information. SupplierVariants and various supplements are the primary entities. This is the most interacted with domain group.

## Distribution

This contains the functionality surrounding purchase orders and fulfillment of those orders. PurchaseOrders are the primary entities.
