# What is Resonance?

Resonance is an e-commerce platform focused on Marketplaces. A Marketplace is an e-commerce site with multiple suppliers.

## Main Concepts

Resonance is composed of **Suppliers** and **Demanders**.

### Suppliers

Suppliers are where goods are supplied. This could be a warehouse, a group of digital creations, or even your garage. Sample important metrics are inventory quantity and cost.

### Demanders

Demanders are where goods are sold. Demanders are composed of one to many storefronts. These can be things like websites, mobile apps, or other, 3rd party marketplaces. Sample important metrics are quantity sold and price. **A Demander must be populated by Suppliers**. Every order placed on a storefront will be routed to a Supplier for delivery. The payment will be split between the Supplier and the Demander according to the Cost dictated by the Supplier.

### User Accounts

Your user account can access and create any number of Suppliers and Demanders. A Supplier can approve their supply be open to any number of Demanders and a Demander can implement any number of Suppliers.

In addition to this, user accounts are shared amongst all Storefronts. Customers will be able to use the same credentials at any Resonance storefront, and this will also enable them to save and use addresses, payment information, etc. A user with suppliers or demanders can also use the same account as a customer.

### Apps

Apps can be created for, and installed on, both Suppliers and Demanders. Apps will be specific to one or the other, however.

### Subscriptions

Demanders require having a subscription in order to activate. Suppliers are free to create and maintain.
