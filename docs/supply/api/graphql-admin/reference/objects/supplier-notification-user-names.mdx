These users will get notified if something requires attention for this Supplier.
If none are provided, ownerUserName will be notified.

```graphql
type SupplierNotificationUserNames {
  distribution: [String!]
  management: [String!]
  purchaseOrders: [String!]
}
```


### Fields

#### [`distribution`](#) ([`[String!]`](/supply/api/graphql-admin/reference/scalars/string))

All notifications for the distribution side, besides purchaseOrders.


#### [`management`](#) ([`[String!]`](/supply/api/graphql-admin/reference/scalars/string))

All notifications for the management side (Products, Variants, etc.).


#### [`purchaseOrders`](#) ([`[String!]`](/supply/api/graphql-admin/reference/scalars/string))

These are part of distribution, but are a specific enough case to be handled separately.
